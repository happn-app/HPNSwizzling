A swizzling that works.

## Installation
Either via SPM (recommended), or by copying `NSObject+HPNSwizzling.{h,m}` into your project.

### Important Note
The repository does have an `xcodeproj` with a shared scheme for debug purposes.
The project might be compatible with Carthage–or not.
It is not officially supported but might work for you.

## Usage
```objectivec
@import HPNSwizzling; /* If installed via SPM. */

@implementation NSView (MyViewAdditions)

static void MySetFrame(id self, SEL _cmd, CGRect frame);
static void (*OriginalSetFrame)(id self, SEL _cmd, CGRect frame);

static void MySetFrame(id self, SEL _cmd, CGRect frame) {
   // ***** CUSTOM WORK HERE *****
   OriginalSetFrame(self, _cmd, frame);
   // ***** OR HERE *****
}

+ (void)load
{
   CHECKED_SWIZZLE(NSView, setFrame:, MySetFrame, OriginalSetFrame);
}

@end
```

## Developers Notes
The include folder in the HPNSwizzling source code folder is there for SPM-compatibility.
It contains a special `HPNSwizzling.h` umbrella header and a soft link to the other header.
